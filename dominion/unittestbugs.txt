I did not run into much bugs while writing the unit tests. But one bug I ran
into was that when I was writing the unit tests was the actual testing part.
When I would be texting different things I used values that made it fail and
pass at the same time because the logic I had written did not check the test
effectively. Other than that I did not run into any other bugs while coding even
though I ran into this bug multiple times.
