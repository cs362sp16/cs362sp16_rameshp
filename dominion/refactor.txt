Documented Changes

Changes in dominion.c:

1. I chose 5 cards to refactor. They were smithy, village, adventurer, remodel, and council room.
2. I created 5 five functions with their respective names and then copied and pasted the code from each individual case in the switch statement into its respective function.
3. I added the appropriate parameters for each function depending on which variables were being passed in.
4. In the switch statement under each case, I added the function call to the respective function that I had created.

Changes in dominion.h:

1. I added function declarations as how to it was done for the other functions. Here are the function declarations outlined below.

    int smithyCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
    int adventurerCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int drawntreasure, int temphand[10], int cardDrawn);
    int villageCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
    int remodelCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int choice1, int choice2, int handPos, int j);
    int councilRoomCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos);
