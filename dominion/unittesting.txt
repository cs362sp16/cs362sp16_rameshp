For this assignment, we had to use gcov to measure to test coverage for the unit
tests that we had to write. In the output file, it outputs all the tests whether
it passes or not and the coverage. The coverage I got was 18.60% of 559 lines.
Although, this coverage is not as high as it should be, it means that I need to
add more depth in my tests. Some of the unit tests were difficult to write as I
had to determine what the output of the given function was. Finding the correct
syntax for what the Makefile for the unit tests should like was also a challenge.
