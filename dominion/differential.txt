This is not an ideal case for differential testing because there are too many
issues with the overall game. This makes it very difficult to decide who is
correct. The code coverage was not what was expected in either code that I
tested. My coverage was well below 60% which told me that my code needs more
revisions. I believe there is a bug within my random tester that creates an
issue for appropriate code coverage.
