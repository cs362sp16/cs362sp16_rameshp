Bug Report 2

There is a bug in remodelCardEffect() as it does not behave correctly.

Description: The remodel card trashes a card from the current hand that you have
and gain a card costing up to two coins more than the original card. However, the
current implementation does not allow the player to gain another card matching
that criteria. 

To fix the bug we would have to alter the main if statement as follows:

	if ((getCost(state->hand[currentPlayer][choice1]) + 2) > getCost(choice2))

This should produce the appropriate result.

Priority: High
Severity: High
