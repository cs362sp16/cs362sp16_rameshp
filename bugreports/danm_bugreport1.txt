Bug Report 1

There is a bug in smithyCardEffect() as it does not behave correctly.

Description: Smithy is an action card from the base set. When this card is chosen
you should be allowed to draw three cards, however, this current implementation
does not allow that to happen.

To fix the bug we would have to alter the for loop as follows:

	for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)

This should produce the appropriate result.

Priority: High
Severity: Medium
